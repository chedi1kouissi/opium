We ran load tests on the staging environment and discovered some concerning performance bottlenecks.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- API response times exceed 2 seconds with 1,000 concurrent users\n- Database queries on the /api/products endpoint averaging 1,240ms (target: 300ms)\n- Critical slow query: SELECT * FROM orders JOIN users... taking 1.8 seconds\n\n**My Recommendation:**\nI strongly suggest we delay the launch from March 15th to March 29th (2-week extension). This gives us time to:\n\n1. Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed endpoints\n2. Add composite database indexes on orders table\n3. Optimize the N+1 query problem in product recommendations\n4. Run comprehensive load testing with 5,000 concurrent users\n\nI know this impacts marketing's timeline, but launching with poor performance could damage our reputation and user retention. Can we schedule a call this afternoon to discuss?\n\nBest regards,\nMarcus Johnson\nEngineering Lead, CloudSync",

Redis caching layer for high-traffic API endpoints (targeting 70% faster response times)\n2. Database index optimization for orders and products tables\n3. Enhanced load balancing configuration\n4. Comprehensive performance testing with 5,000 concurrent users\n\n**Positive Impacts:**\n\u2705 Extended beta testing period = more user feedback incorporated\n\u2705 Marketing team has additional time to refine campaign materials\n\u2705 Engineering team can deliver truly production-ready performance\n\u2705 Reduced risk of negative reviews due to slow performance\n\n**Budget:**\nNo change - marketing budget remains at $45,000\n\n**Stakeholder Communication:**\nLisa Park's team will notify our beta users this week, positioning the delay as our commitment to quality.\n\nI'm confident this is the right decision for CloudSync and our users. Launching a high-quality, performant product is more valuable than hitting an arbitrary date.\n\nQuestions? I'm available all week.\n\nBest regards,\nSarah Chen\nProduct Manager, CloudSync"
